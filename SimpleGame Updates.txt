Current Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GetAsyncKeyState does not check if the Window is active 
***Possible FIX: Think about a state to check if Game is in active 
window. Make that a ncessary thing to change the key state to 
DOWN. If not, then push for the UP (always checking that it 
only gets called once)

Deleting Objects and Updating Service Locator is not working properly
